# Object Oriented Programming - Chess Implementation

Welcome to our implementation of Chess! 

Our project is a recreation of the 8 by 8 game Chess played through the command line with a supporting GUI, designed using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and integrated with overarching design patterns such as the Model Controller View (MVC), Factory Design Pattern, Observer Design Pattern.

Users are able to choose between either a default chessboard or to set up a custom game board by placing and removing pieces. Users can choose to play against Human or Computer (AI) players, with the Computer having further options of specifying a level of difficulty out of three.
Our implementation includes various features such as employing move validation and supporting special moves such as pawn promotion, castling, and en passant. We completed the entire project without memory leaks by handling all memory 
management by STL containers and smart pointers. We also have an additional feature to skip a player's turn, as well as the ability for users to resign during the game.
